Project Overview

This project consists of two distinct parts:

1. Simple Chatbot:
   - Objective: Create a chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.
   - Techniques: Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.
   - Learning Outcomes: Gain a basic understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and conversation flow.

2. AI Agent for Tic-Tac-Toe:
   - Objective: Develop an AI agent that can play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player.
   - Techniques: Implement algorithms like Minimax, with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning, to make the AI player unbeatable.
   - Learning Outcomes: Understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

What the Projects Do

1. Simple Chatbot:
   - Functionality:
     - The chatbot receives user input.
     - It uses predefined rules (if-else statements or pattern matching) to identify the user's query.
     - The chatbot provides appropriate responses based on the identified query.
   - Example Interaction:
     - User: "Hello"
     - Chatbot: "Hello! How can I help you today?"

2. AI Agent for Tic-Tac-Toe:
   - Functionality:
     - The AI agent can play Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player.
     - It uses the Minimax algorithm (with optional Alpha-Beta Pruning) to make optimal moves.
     - The AI is designed to be unbeatable, always making the best possible move.
   - Example Interaction:
     - The user and AI take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
     - The AI calculates the best move at each step, ensuring it either wins or forces a draw.

Benefits and Learning Outcomes

- Simple Chatbot:
  - Provides hands-on experience with basic natural language processing techniques.
  - Helps understand the flow of conversations and how to design rule-based responses.
  
- AI Agent for Tic-Tac-Toe:
  - Offers practical experience with game theory and search algorithms.
  - Demonstrates how AI can be used to solve deterministic games with a perfect strategy.
  - Enhances problem-solving skills by implementing and optimizing algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

By completing these projects, you'll gain foundational knowledge in both natural language processing and game theory, which are essential areas in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
